The client.py can be used to send messages between two peers.

## How to run?

open terminal and start client.py

open another terminal and start another client.py

for both, give an IP and port to bind socket eg. for the first client 127.0.0.1 and port 5000, for the second client 127.0.0.1 and port 6000

Then to send messages, type the other peer ip and port as well.
